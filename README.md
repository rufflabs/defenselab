# Defense Network Lab

The Defense Network Lab is built around the internal network of a ficticious company. The Defense Network
is an auditing and cybersecurity consulting firm. 

As they expanded their business they had to grow their IT services and executive management. With some new
business and potential clients they have had to start adhereing to various audit and security control requirements.

One of those requirements is to have a penetration test performed to test the security controls of the Defense Network.

Your role is to come in as a security contractor to audit the Defense Network and create a penetration test report. 

## Lab Requirements
The Defense Network lab is designed around using minimal resources, and uses VirtualBox and Vagrant to create a predictable
lab environment. To deploy the lab you will need to have VirtualBox and Vagrant installed.
